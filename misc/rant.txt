Some decisions.

Cell does not have Serialize() method. It makes more sense 
to associate a strategy to a page (not cell) to have a uniform 
byte representation within the same page.

A tuple serializer should remembers (be intialized with) a schema,
so that it doesn't have to decypher a schema each time.

tuple.Value should be moved out of the tuple package ,since I want it
to be able to serialize itself, because otherwise I'd have
to type cast/guess it. (it doesn't have to know how to deserialize itself though)
